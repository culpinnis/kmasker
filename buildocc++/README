What is it?
===========

This component will build an occ file from fasta/fastq files. It is based on the example code of query_per_sequence.cc of the jellyfish project. These files are following the same terms of licence as the files in the jellyfish project.

How to build?
=============

You have to build this file against libjellyfish. On most linux systems you can do this in the following manner:

g++ -std=c++0x -Wall -O3 -ljellyfish-2.0 -L/path/to/jellyfish/libs -I/path/to/jellyfish/includes -lpthread -Wl,--rpath=/path/to/jellyfish/libs buildocc.cc -o buildocc


How to use?
============

The component will be integrated into the kmasker user interface. 
However, you can use this tool as standalone utility of course.

$ ./buildpcc db.jf sequence.fa > sequence.occ

resulting occ:
>read1
0 0 0 1 1 2 3 3 3 4 2
>read2
15 16 17 13 12 11 12 12 10 7 6
...

Good to know!
=============

The occ file will have a line break after 25 elements. The last k-1 bases of the fasta sequence will be filled with zeros due to the fact that they will have no complete kmer.
The tool will use all settings from the jellyfish run which created the jellyfish database file (db.jf). These informations are stored in the databases header.
